# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the task to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.  The Board of Elections would like to know the total number of votes cast, including percentage of votes, for each candidate who received a vote.  They would also like to know who won the election with the most votes.  The Board of Elections would also like to know the total votes casts, and percentages, for all counties that had people vote.  


## Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv

Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Election-Audit Summary
With the analysis from this data, the Colorado Board of Elections can clearly see which candidates recieved a vote, how many votes and the percentage of the votes. The Board can also see which county is generating the majority of the votes, and the breakdown of each county that has votes cast.  The Board of Elections can use this script for any data set, in which they collect the county and candidadates name.  The modification will have to be done to the code, for the name of the csv file and possibly where the file is stored on the computer.  This code will work if new candidadtes names or counties are generated, or a larger sample is given.  The same thing is true for the counties.  

The scirpt may also be modified if other information is collected on the votes.  If the Board of Elections would like to know the age groups of voters, this could be added to the script, as long as the data is included in the csv file.  All of this information could help the Board of Elections understand who/where is casting the most votes, and which candidate they are voting for.  This could also be used by candidates, so they know where they may need to spend time campaigning more.
